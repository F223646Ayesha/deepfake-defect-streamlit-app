# üéØ AI-Powered Prediction App

This project is part of **Data Science Assignment 4**, focusing on **binary classification of audio deepfakes** and **multi-label classification of bug reports**. The final deliverable is a **real-time Streamlit application** allowing users to upload `.wav` files or enter text and get live predictions using different ML models.

## üß† Tasks Implemented

### üîπ Part 1: Audio Deepfake Detection (Binary Classification)
- Synthetic audio signal generation for bonafide/spoof
- MFCC feature extraction with `librosa`
- Trained classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Perceptron
  - Deep Neural Network (2 hidden layers)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall

### üîπ Part 2: Bug Report Defect Prediction (Multi-label Classification)
- Tfidf vectorization of short bug report texts
- Manual multi-label vectors (blocker, bug, regression, etc.)
- Models: OneVsRest with LR, SVM, Perceptron + DNN
- Metrics: Hamming Loss, Micro/Macro F1 Score

### üîπ Part 3: Streamlit App
- Upload `.wav` files for real-time deepfake detection
- Enter bug report text for defect label predictions
- Select model at runtime (SVM, LR, DNN, Perceptron)
- Waveform plot with full/short view toggle
- Confidence scores shown as progress bars
- Fully modular and interactive interface
